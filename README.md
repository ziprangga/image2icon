# [![image2icon](resources/image2icon.png)](resources/image2icon.png) image2icon

**image2icon** is my personal tool for create icns and ico. I created this application to help speed up the process of converting png to icns or ico. This application was originally for learning rust integration to python with safer_ffi. If you want to use it please download or compile from source.
